Rune Of Soul:: H: Fascinating, this shard seems to have the capability to generate extra souls, although the utility seems limited.<br>F: Isn't generating souls, like, incredibly powerful?<br>H: Well, they only are "extra", we already have one, it's kinda like tacking an additional one onto what already exists.<br>F: So what?<br>H: If we already have one soul, we dont really need more of them, and it only produces more on beings that already have one.<br>F: Can't we harvest them, start making our own souls?<br>H: No, they are only released on death, and we have no way to capture them. Plus, I don't want to have to deal with any potential negative effects of having multiple souls.

Rune Of Collapse:: God: I am going to be honest, I kinda half-assed the code behind this one, so if it breaks, thats probably why.<br><br>H: Who-What-Huh? What was that?<br>F: What?<br>H: I swear I heard something just now.<br>F: I didn't hear anything.<br>H: Maybe you have bad ears.<br>F: Maybe you are crazy.<br>H: That's actually a very real possibility.

Aquarq:: K: Why does the blue stone glow so much?<br>H: Honestly, no clue.<br>K: It's not radioactive, right?<br>H: Radiation glow is just a myth, the cliche green color comes from Radium and Tritium.<br>K: So why is it glowing?
