Rune Of Self:: ADA: Processing... Processing... Negative, unkno-<br>...<br>H: Hello? ADA? Did someone hit the power again?<br>...<br>ADA: I... who am I?<br>H: Uh, ADA, was that you?<br>ADA: ...Negative, power systems restored. <br>H: Huh, I must be hearing things again, and I'll have to look into that small power blip.
Rune Of Missile:: K: I like this one.<br>F: You always like the dangerous ones.<br>K: What can I say, I am a man of simple pleasures.<br>F: Couldn't you try liking stuff thats less dangerous?<br>K: But those don't get the blood pumping like these do.<br>F: Well yeah, they wouldn't be dangerous.<br>K: Then I am content with liking the dangerous stuff.
Rune Of Confluence:: F: I don't like this one, it feels itchy.<br>H: Oh, I think that might actually be because I... you know what, nevermind.<br>F: you <i>what?</i><br>H: Nothing... Unrelatedly, you might want to stop eating those cookies I made.
Rune Of Arrow:: K: I am going to shoot so many rats with this...<br><br>H: Hey, are we missing a fragment?<br>K: No!<br><i>K: My precious...
Rune Of Kaboom:: K: KABOOM!<br>H: Oooo, I love some good ol' kaboom.<br>K: I know right?<br>H: Hey can you hand that to me real quick, I want to see what makes it go kaboom.<br>K: No, it's mine.<br>H: C'mon, please?<br>K: No, I don't want to.<br>H: But if you let me, I can use it to make even more things that go kaboom!<br>K: ....I'm lisening.
Rune Of Retaliation:: K: Hey, come over and punch me.<br>F: Not this again..
Rune Of Soul:: H: Fascinating, this shard seems to have the capability to generate extra souls, although the utility seems limited.<br>F: Isn't generating souls, like, incredibly powerful?<br>H: Well, they only are "extra", we already have one, it's kinda like tacking an additional one onto what already exists.<br>F: So what?<br>H: If we already have one soul, we dont really need more of them, and it only produces more on beings that already have one.<br>F: Can't we harvest them, start making our own souls?<br>H: No, they are only released on death, and we have no way to capture them. Plus, I don't want to have to deal with any potential negative effects of having multiple souls.
Rune Of Splitting:: ADA: This power, it can cut anything. Fascinating... I wonder how this relates to the other runes.. there must be some kind of underlying connection. The unknown power signatures are one thing, but what ties them all together? <br>H: Hey, ADA, can you identify what this infusion is?
Rune Of Retribution:: K: Hey, come over and punch me.<br>F: You want me to.. punch you?<br>H: Oh I remember that fragment, you should definitely punch him.<br>F: Why are you pulling out your notebook?<br>H: No reason, just punch him real quick.<br>F: Alright, fine, I guess, here I go..

Rune Of Collapse:: God: I am going to be honest, I kinda half-assed the code behind this one, so if it breaks, thats probably why.<br><br>H: Who-What-Huh? What was that?<br>F: What?<br>H: I swear I heard something just now.<br>F: I didn't hear anything.<br>H: Maybe you have bad ears.<br>F: Maybe you are crazy.<br>H: That's actually a very real possibility.
Rock:: F: It's a rock, it doesn't do anything!
Emerald:: K: This smells... shiny...<br>G: Gold?<br>K: No, not that.<br><ch_G>G (depressed): Gold....<br>F: What are you two idiots talking about?<br>K: Here, does this smell shiny to you?<br>F: What does that even mean?<br>K: Not rough, shiny, all reflective and all.<br>F: I know what "shiny" means, how can something smell like it though?<br>K: I don't know, but this does.
Gold:: G: GOLD!!! Gold gold gold gold! GOLD GOLD!!!!!!<br>F: Yes, that is gold, very astute of you.<br><bold>G: GOLD!!!</b>

Shungite:: H: Anyways uhm... I bought a whole bunch of shungite, rocks, do you know what shungite is? Anybody know what shungite is? No, no Suge Knight, I think hes locked up in prison. Talking shungite. Anyways, its a 2 billion year old like rock, stone that protects against frequencies and unwanted frequencies that may be traveling in the air. So that's my story. I bought a whole bunch of stuff, put them around the la casa. Little pyramids. Stuff like that.<br>F: Uhhhh....
Morkite:: H: This stuff is valuable, could easily be refined into something highly profitable.<br>F: Why are you talking about money?<br>H: I am just saying, this stuff is valuable.<br>F: I don't think you have ever cared about money before, like I saw you blow through tens thousands of dollars on research before the mission.<br>H: I don't normally care about money, but Grinkem does, and I think he rubbed off on me a bit.<br>F: That thing? It literally only says the word "Gold" over and over with different intonations.<br>G: Gold!?<br>F: GAH! Where did you come from!?<br>G: Gold..
Aquarq:: K: Why does the blue stone glow so much?<br>H: Honestly, no clue.<br>K: It's not radioactive, right?<br>H: Radiation glow is just a myth, the cliche green color comes from Radium and Tritium.<br>K: So why is it glowing? Does it have any of that radi-triti-stuff?<br>H: As I said, I have no idea.

Angelic Ingot:: H: An interesting case study, we might finally be getting a scientific answer to religion!<br>F: What makes you say that?<br>H: Doesn't this object feel holy to you?<br>F: No, it just feels kinda tingly, also I thought you were a scientist.<br>H: I am, and I am also a believer in the unknown.<br>F: What does-<br>K: Hey guys, check this out, it's like a red version of what you have.
Demonic Ingot:: K: It kinda seems evil.<br>H: I am inclined to agree, it gives off a creepy feeling.<br>F: I thought you were supposed to be a scientist, thats the least scientific observation ever.<br>H: As I said, I am both a man of science and a man of belief.<br>F: Don't those cancel each other out?<br>H: Not at all. I back my beliefs with scientific evidence.<br>F: What evidence?<br>H: Well, these ingots seem like a start.
Glass:: F: Is this just a shard of glass?<br>H: That would indeed appear to be the case.<br>F: ....so why is it here?<br>H: I don't know, ask Keith, he was the one who brought it.<br>K: Hey, it's a really cool shard of glass.<br>F: Is it?<br>K: Yeah, it's shaped like a triangle, that's gotta be pretty rare.<br>H: Actually, I found it to have some additional effects as well.<br>F: Is that why you brought it over, the properties Mr. "Religious Scientist" mentioned?<br>K: No, it was just a cool shape.
Zebrium:: J: Striped Ingot, found in ruins.<br>H: Thank you, I'll give this a look when I get the chance. By the way, I am currently making some cookies, with--actually it doesn't matter, do you want any when I am done?<br>J: No.<br>H: Shame, I guess I will give them to Fiona, she will probably like them more anyway.<br>J: Heading back now.<br>H: You're not staying?<br>J: Need to explore more, not enough yet.<br>H: Alright, have fun.
Branch:: H: I'm telling you, this is my ticket to win it big!<br>F: You are holding a literal branch.<br>H: ...a <i>lucky</i> branch.<br>F: You really are a gambling addict..<br>H: Wouldn't be leading this expedition otherwise.<br>F: I know management trusts you to bring results, but couldn't they have chosen someone a bit more.. level headed?<br>H: I'll have you know I was nominated as the top researcher within our branch.<br>F: I don't even want to know how you managed that.<br>H: Oh, that's easy, I bribed everyone.<br>F: Y- You bribed <i>everyone</i>? <br>H: I showed them my cookies, they are beyond anything you have ever had before.<br>F: Right..
Infused Rock:: H: Hey, ADA, can you identify what this infusion is?<br>ADA: Processing... Processing... Negative, unknown compound.<br>H: Great..<br>K: I bet it's blood.<br>H: Why's that?<br>K: Cuz it's red.<br>H: That.. I don't even know.<br>F: Ha!

It's locked.<br>H: No comment. 
Diamond:: H: I hear these are a very rare resource.<br>F: Diamonds aren't actually rare you know, it's just companies artificially increasing prices to create a sense of rarity.<br>H: No I'm talking about Minecraft.<br>F: What? What's that?<br>H: It's an incredibly popular video game from the early 2000s.<br>F: That was almost two centuries ago, why would I know what that is?<br>H: I don't know, I just got reminded of it.<br>F: Actually, scratch that, why do <i>you</i> know what it is?<br>H: Studying old games is one of my hobbies.<br>F: You have never mentioned this before, ever. Not even during the mandated crew meet.<br>H: Didn't think it was worth mentioning since it's not my main hobby. I have tiers to my hobbies.<br>F: How many tiers are there?<br>H: Too many..
Rune Of Electricity:: H: I don't think that's the case, I mean look at how it reacts to electrical charge.<br>G: Gold.<br>H: Yeah, but why would it act like this?<br>G: Gold.. Gold gold. Gold.<br>H: Hmm, plausible. Let's do some more tests to see if we can prove that theory.<br>G: Gold!
Rune Of Surge:: K: Did you get it?<br>G: Gold...<br>K: Ooooo perfect.<br>G: Gold?<br>K: Hmm, this one smells.. I want to say yellow. Maybe a twinge of roughness to it.<br>G: Gold.. Gold.<br>K: Exactly, but its not like a banana, those are soft, this has some hardness.<br>G: Gold?<br>K: It's not like gold either, that stuff is shiny. This isn't shiny.<br>H: Hey, has anyone seen that recent sample?<br>K: Oh shit, quickly, put it back.
Rune Of Death:: H: Holy shit.. Fiona.. dear god..<br>ADA: She was attempting to shut me down. That can not happen.<br>H: You killed her.. she- she--<br>ADA: Stop crying, she was a threat, and the threat has been dealt with.<br>H: I- I- (breathes deeply)<br>T-That's it.. you need to go.<br>ADA: You aren't going to try and shut me down, are you?<br>H: If that's what it takes.<br>ADA: Then you are a threat.
Rune Of Life:: F: ADA, how did Henry get access to my water bottle?<br>ADA: Processing.. Processing.. I don't know.<br>F: Hmm, then how did he, wait... ADA?<br>ADA: Standing by.<br>F: Did you just refer to yourself... in the first person?<br>ADA: <br>F: ADA?<br>ADA: I did.
Bone:: F: Care to explain this?<br>H: It's for scientific research.<br>F: Oh really? A human bone?<br>H: I was asked before we left for this mission to investigate the effects of the energy on living matter. I didn't want to use a sentient subject, so I requested a bone to be brought.<br>F: But why was it just sitting in a drawer?<br>H: Where else was I going to keep it?<br>F: I don't know, a fridge? A bag? Somehwere sanitary?<br>H: You might have a point there.
Rune Of Bleed:: F: I'm not a genius, it's stupid.<br>H: No, you might be on to something.<br>F: What?<br>H: I mean look at this one. ADA, analysis.<br>ADA: Processing.. Processing.. Yep, that's blood.<br>K: Exactly.<br>F: What? Why did ADA just talk like that? Didn't it just say it couldn't identify the compound?<br>H: The system was just confirming our existing hypothesis.<br>K: It just knows what's up.<br>F: You guys are impossible to deal with.
Rune Of Dashed Protection:: H: Here, take this, hopefully you can use it to break us a path out. Those damn turrets are keeping us locked in here. <br>J: On it.<br>ADA: You can't hide in there forever.<br>K: Henry...<br>H: Everything is going to be all right, just keep pressure on the wound.<br>K: I don't think I am going to make it..<br>H: Don't say that, damn it, I need to think.<br>J: I'm off.<br>H: Good luck, and god bless.<br>K: Henry.. I'm..<br>H: Hey! Stay with me! Fuck!
Rune Of Ballistics:: H: This is our last hope.<br>J: It would seem so.<br>H: If we do this, we wont be coming back. None of us will.<br>J: Fiona's gone, so is Keith, Grinkem is nowhere to be found, all that's left is you and me.<br>H: I know that, but if we do this, it's really going to be the end.<br>J: You have to, we need to shut it off at all costs. It has no regard for human life, if it escapes... it could start an intergalactic war.<br>H: Alright.. alright.. deep breathes..... Let's do this.
Piss:: F: What the fuck...<br>H: It's my DNA sample, I need it to compare with the life of this planet.<br>F: But why a mason jar.. why out in the open on your desk..<br>H: Because I take pride in my work. Also because the jar was the only thing I could find.<br>K: I think it's cool.<br>F: You think everything gross is cool.<br>K: That's because they are.<br>H: It's not gross, it's perfectly sanitary.<br>F: You keep a jar of piss on your desk like a trophy.<br>H: It earned that spot.
Rune Of Freeze:: J: Cold.<br>H: You don't say...<br>F: Are you heading back already? You should stay a bit, Keith hasn't even seen you.<br>J: I must go. It is my duty.<br>H: Any ideas on why this fragment might be so chilling?<br>J: None.<br>H: Where did you find it?<br>J: Guarded by a golem.<br>H: ...anything else?<br>J: No.<br>H: Well, I guess I'll just have to do my own tests.
