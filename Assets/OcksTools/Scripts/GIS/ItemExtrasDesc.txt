Rune Of Self:: H1: Reminds me of my progenitor.
Rune Of Missile:: K: I like this one.<br>F: You always like the dangerous ones.<br>K: What can I say, I am a man of simple pleasures.<br>F: Couldn't you try liking stuff thats less dangerous?<br>K: But those don't get the blood pumping like these do.<br>F: Well yeah, they wouldn't be dangerous.<br>K: Then I am content with liking the dangerous stuff.
Rune Of Confluence:: F: I don't like this one, it feels itchy.<br>H: Oh, I think that might actually be because I... you know what, nevermind.<br>F: you <i>what?</i><br>H: Nothing... Unrelatedly, you might want to stop eating those cookies I made.

Rune Of Soul:: H: Fascinating, this shard seems to have the capability to generate extra souls, although the utility seems limited.<br>F: Isn't generating souls, like, incredibly powerful?<br>H: Well, they only are "extra", we already have one, it's kinda like tacking an additional one onto what already exists.<br>F: So what?<br>H: If we already have one soul, we dont really need more of them, and it only produces more on beings that already have one.<br>F: Can't we harvest them, start making our own souls?<br>H: No, they are only released on death, and we have no way to capture them.

Aquarq:: K: Why does the blue stone glow so much?<br>H: Honestly, no clue.<br>K: It's not radioactive, right?<br>H: Radiation glow is just a myth, the cliche green color comes from Radium and Tritium.<br>K: So why is it glowing?
