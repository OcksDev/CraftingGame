</> 
</> <Name=ADA>
</> It is my job, <Wait=0.2>as an AI assistant tool, <Wait=0.2>to get you aquainted with our Company Sponsored Research Outpost #576.<Wait=0.8> It is also my job to help you in the discovery of our universe.<br><Wait=0.6>Hail to Concord!<Wait=1.3><Skip>
</> 
</> <Name=ADA>
</> Now, I think it's time I show you the basics.<Wait=0.7> Currently the camp is a bit run down due to an.. <Wait=0.7>incident..<Wait=0.7> but everything is fine, <Wait=0.2>the camp can be repaired with harvested resources.<Wait=1.3><Skip>
</> 
</> <Name=ADA>
</> These resources can be found down in the mines below, <Wait=0.2>but be careful, <Wait=0.2>monsters and other anomalies have infested the tunnels.<Wait=0.7> I trust you will be able to handle them,<Wait=0.2> as does our company.<Wait=1.3><Skip>
</> 
</> <Name=ADA>
</> You can't forget afterall, <Wait=0.2>our mission is to research the unknown energies emitted from these mines, <Wait=0.2>and getting yourself killed will result in a reduced paycheck.<Wait=0.7> Anyway, <Wait=0.2>I've gotten a bit sidetracked, <Wait=0.2>and I am running low on power.<Wait=1.3><Skip>
</> 
</> <Name=ADA>
</> My last piece of advice before I rest is to try and make do with what you can, <Wait=0.3>use the materials in the mines to make weapons if you must, <Wait=0.3>just make sure to believe in the interests of Concord,<Wait=0.2> and everything will be fine.<Wait=1.3><Skip>
</> <End>
