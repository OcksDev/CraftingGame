

Requires:
TextMeshPro


Setup:
Should just be good to go off the bat, make sure object referecnes are all set up.
You can use the setup machine in OcksTools>Console>Setup
    But this will not fully set it up, and you need to use the fix mentioned below


Console refusing to accept any inputs and not showing any logged messages?
    More than likely the InputField gameobject isnt calling the correct function
        To fix this find the object, reference the ConsoleHandler object, in the script ConsoleLol select Submit()
        This should fix the problem.
        If it doesn't then idk man your on your own on this one









Benefits:
   Easy game control and allows players to fuck with shit
   Gives access to players to view a console, and gives access to Console.Instance.ConsoleLog();
      Allows players/devs to get further insight in the innerworkings of the game.
      Similar functionality to Debug.Log(); but can easily be viewed in builds and during runtime
          also allows for easily customizable messaging
