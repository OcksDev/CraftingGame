
Installs:
- Relay
- Netcode for Gameobjects
- whatever this is: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop.git?path=/Packages/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop#main 
	- The package also has a reference here incase the download link changes: https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/components/networktransform#clientnetworktransform


Steps:
1. Install packages shown above
   1a. If the package needs to be downloaded via githup and you have never done so before, you will need to install GitBash and restart unity/computer to download packages from Git.
2. Setup the project with a project ID (Edit > Project Settings) for the unity dashboard inside a company who has Relay
   2a. If you don't have a unity company with Relay, make one. (I set one up a while ago so I don't remember the step by step process to make one)  
3. Enable relay within the unity dashboard (make sure its the right project)
that should be it, unless something changed from when I made this
